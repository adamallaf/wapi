<div class="contents">
<p><a href="http://github.com/vy/wapi">WAPI</a> provides an easy-to-use function set to configure wireless network interfaces in a GNU/Linux system. One can think WAPI as a lightweight C API for <code>iwconfig</code>, <code>wlanconfig</code>, <code>ifconfig</code>, and <code>route</code> commands. (But it is not a thin wrapper for these command line tools.) It is designed to be used in wireless heteregenous network research projects and supported by <a href="http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/">BWRC (Berkeley Wireless Research Center)</a> and <a href="http://www.wiserlab.org/">WISERLAB (Wireless Information Systems Engineering Research Laboratory at Özyeğin University)</a>.</p>
<p>For <code>iwconfig</code>, <code>ifconfig</code>, and <code>route</code> command functionalities, WAPI issues same set of ioctl() calls to the netlink kernel. While <code>ifconfig</code> and <code>route</code> doesn't have that many ad-hoc hacks for backward compatibility issues, <code>iwconfig</code> is messed with dozens of such stuff in all around the code. In WAPI, we try to avoid all such hacks and target recent hardware and kernel versions (&gt;2.6). But most of the time, it should just work fine. For virtual (wireless) interface management, we rely on <a href="http://linuxwireless.org/en/developers/Documentation/nl80211">nl80211</a> netlink interface. (Which is actually intended to replace Wireless Extensions.)</p>

<p>You can track the changes and obtain the sources from <a href="http://github.com/vy/wapi">http://github.com/vy/wapi</a> address. You can also directly download the sources of the most recent version from here (<a href="files/wapi-0.1.tar.gz">wapi-0.1.tar.gz</a>) as well. <a href="http://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>, <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html">wireless-tools</a>, and <a href="http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/">libnl</a> packages are required to compile the sources.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="whatiswapi"></a>
What is WAPI?</h3>
<p>WAPI is a C library that provides a developer friendly API to a majority of the network interface configurations in a GNU/Linux system. One can think it as an interface to the ifconfig, iwconfig, route, and wlanconfig command line tools. But WAPI just shares the functionality of these tools, nothing more. That is, instead of calling ifconfig, etc. and parsing its console output, WAPI directly communicates with the Linux kernel via appropriate ioctl() and nl80211 interface calls.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="whatareothers"></a>
What are other similar projects?</h3>
<p>There is just iwlib of wireless-tools project, which just provides access to some of the wireless network interface configurations. There are no other libraries for ifconfig, route, and wlanconfig functionalities.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="whatisiwlib"></a>
What is wrong with iwlib?</h3>
<p>Honestly, for the configuration of wireless network interfaces, iwlib is nearly a swiss army knife. But the problem is, it is just restricted to wireless network interfaces and suffers from some performance problems. (That is, if you just want to change the operating frequency of your wireless device and using iwlib, you must first collect all of its available configurations, just update frequency in there, and write back all available configurations to driver again. In other words, no attribute specific access.) And considering its age, iwlib code base is bloated with backwards compatibility hacks in everywhere. Being said that, WAPI still uses iwlib for some particular operations. (For instance, while parsing event streams supplied by WEXT module.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="whatisnl80211"></a>
Why not using nl80211?</h3>
<p>nl80211 is the new 802.11 netlink interface for Linux kernel. For particular feature sets (e.g. virtual interface management) we rely on nl80211. While nl80211 is quite mature, it doesn't support as many devices as wext does. But it would be a good TODO item to port all wireless interface related ioctl() calls to their nl80211 correspondents.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="wapifeatures"></a>
Does WAPI provides all available feature sets?</h3>
<p>Ofcourse, not. (At least not at this point.) WAPI is just designed to meet our research needs. If you need any other feature implementations, just drop me a mail.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="openwrt"></a>
Can I integrate WAPI to OpenWrt as well?</h3>
<p>Sure! Just see <code>Makefile.OpenWrt</code> in the root directory.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="foundbug"></a>
I found a bug. What then?</h3>
<p>Just report me via e-mail. (A detailed explanation to reproduce the problem would be awesome.) I will try to fix it ASAP. </p>
